There were moments where I wanted to add a specifc camera effect in my charts
but couldn't find it in base game's events, so I made this
Plan: Have camera shaders such as vignete and bloom and chromatic scale and Film Grain and Lens (Not too sure about the last two)

All of them has to support easing and the time should be steps instead of seconds
All of them should be in CamGame (maybe make it a choice later on?)

Event properties
Vignete:
- Intensity
- Easing type
- Length in steps

Bloom:
- Intensity
- Easing type
- Length in steps

Chroma:
- Intensity
- Easing type
- Length in steps

Since I'm having trouble with shaders, I went for simpler events
that I or others may need such as camera rotation and camera shake event
I should do a fade in/out camera effect too with colors

Couldn't do it with colors lol, we'll stick with the common color which is black
I should also do camera flash event sticking with the white color and maybe a toggle to have the red color too as it's somewhat common

I think I'm okay with this one, current events are in and work fine

Just had a thought of maybe adding a "add text" event
because I can see myself wanting to add a text as a subtitle text for songs with lyrical sections or just flavor text
Actually wait I change my mind, I keep forgetting that this is a game
meant for casual audiences to the point the opponent's strumline is intentionally off-center
to make the player focus more on the notes

I just remembered that Spooky Mix has something like this meant for lyrical songs
Modders could maybe just use that

I change my mind, for convenience, I'll just add a "add subtitle event" that behaves pretty much the same as Spooky Mix's or like every subtitles event
I'd need duration as steps, default tween for text to appear, default position that changes between scrolltypes, background color, font choice

For font choice, I was thinking of taking a list of fonts from a json file instead of hardcoding the fonts in the code,
this means that modders could use the default fonts (probably just vcr and maybe phantom-muff font) and add their own fonts with a json patch
Text color is... too much trouble due to abstracts being unsupported and I don't know how to make "choices" options
plus it's way more efficient to have a single color for the text and being able to use symbols around a specifc portion of a text to color it instead (like *this*) <- "this" will turn red while "like" is still white
but that has the same problem

I could maybe make toggles for italic and bold options though, that's the least I could do

EDIT (10:20 PM 3/2/2025): This is scrapped due to Spooky Mix pretty much having all of these features lol, modders can maybe just use that

I just remembered something important too, I should make some sort of "add sound" event (hopefully base game has playOnce method for sounds to make this easier),
I think I should also make a notekind that plays a keysound when hitting,
kind of how charters in Quaver can place notes that play keysounds to make a rhythm (which I loved),
but that goes against the title of this mod lol, ehh probably too much and not really neccesary if you're playing vocals the entire time
and I don't think FNF charters care about this niche stuff (plus what I described is very rare in Quaver so I'll scrap it and go for an event instead)

EDIT (10:28 PM 3/2/2025): Scrapped for the same reason lmao, Spooky Mix has an event that does exactly this (you can even place it behind the strumlines or in front) and thank god playOnce still exists

I think I'm okay with what I currently have although I'd like to take another jab at shaders again

12:28 AM 3/6/2025
I didn't take another jab at shaders like I said in the previous entry, but I finally managed to make the events trigger whether the option is enabled or not (huge)

12:11 PM 3/7/2025
I got the ok from Spooky Mix's director to use/port his events in here (some things have be changed like duration being steps instead of seconds and options)

12:46 AM 3/13/2025
Alright, I can safely and proudly say, I've finished this mod.
Still unfortunate I couldn't get the shader events to work, but I'll find a way to code it in eventually hopefully.
Only thing that bothers me now is not having explanations for the events which I attempted to do by modifying user-guide but didn't work out.
